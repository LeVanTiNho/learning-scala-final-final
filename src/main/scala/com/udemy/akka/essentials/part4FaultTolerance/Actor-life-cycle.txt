ActorRef vs Actor Instance
*Actor instance: is instances of the Actor Class extend Actor Trait
    + has methods
    + may have internal state
* Actor reference = incarnation
    + created with actorOf
    + has mailbox and can receive messages
    + contains one actor instance
    + contains a UUID
* Actor path = can be considered as a place for a ActorRef
    + may or may not have an ActorRef inside

Actor Lifecyle
* Actors can be
    + Started
    + suspended
    + resumed
    + restarted
    + stopped
* Start = Create a new ActorRef with UUID at a give path
* Suspend = the actor ref will enqueue but NOT process more messages
* Resume = the actor ref will continue processing more messages
* Restarting:
    + suspend
    + swap the actor instance of the ActorRef
        - old actor instance calls preRestart
        - replace the current actor instance by a new actor instance
        - new actor instance calls postRestart
Internal state is destroyed on restart
* Stopping: Frees the actor ref within a path
    + The actor instance call postStop
    + All watching actors receive Terminated(ref)
    + The ActorRef is released from the path
The messages in the ActorRef will be lost
* After stopping, another actor may be created at the same path
    + different UUID, so different Actor
